# Some-stupid-assignments-and-labs-from-Saint-Mary-s-University
Countless nights are just recording how stupid i was and i will be.
Mirrored image in the screen of laptop looks like a desperate monster.
Diving into sea of codes to accelerate time elapsing sounds tiring and merciless.
Try to deconnect myself from reality and shower my soul with code.
I just mark down something by code along the way of endless journey
until my true happiness comes to wherever i will be.
